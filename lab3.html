	<h1> Sakeena Younus Lab #3 - Lesson 4 </h1>
	
	<h3> My Baking Journey </h3>
	
	<p> 
		I have been baking for my whole life. It started out when I was a little girl, helping my mom mash the bananas <br>
		for banana bread and add the chocolate chips for cookies. As I got older, I started try new things on my own, <br>
		so it moved on to different flavored cookies, cupcakes, and my first not so pretty cakes. At the end of 2020, <br>
		I decided I wanted to make a birthday cake for my brother's birthday in January. For the entire month of December, <br>
		I researched all the tools and ingredients I would need, watched endless tutorials, and planned every step I would <br>
		take. The actual process of make the cake was very long, but also rewarding. It ended up turning out really well, <br>
		so I made the goal to make all of my family member's cakes for the year of 2020.
	</p>
		
	<h3> What I Learned </h3>
	
	<p> 
		In the year 2020, I ended up making 7 different cakes. During each process I experimented with different flavors <br>
		and techniques, and found myself getting more confident in my skills. Each time I made a cake, I would estimate the <br>
		amount of time it took me to prepare all the components, as well as the decoration process, and I found that for <br>
		each cake, the time I spent would decrease. In January 2022, I experienced a full circle moment when I baked the same <br>
		brother another birthday cake. It was a complete one year journey, and when I look back, I see how much I have progressed, <br>
		not just in baking, but also with the willingness to take risks and try new things!
	</p>
	 
	<h3> What the Future Holds </h3>
	
	<p> 
		During 2021, I was baking a new cake about every two months, and I found myself really enjoying it and wanting to try <br>
		new things! I considered opening a business, and even created a baking Instagram account called Sweets By Sakeena. <br>
		After a lot of deliberation, I realized that creating a small may not be the best idea since it would take a lot of time <br>
		and effort, and I was very focused on school. I still really like the idea of one day creating a business, but for the <br>
		time being, I just bake for my friends and family whenever I can!
	</p>
		
	<h3> What I Made: </h3>
	
	<p> 
		Through my year of baking, I was able to bake 10 different desserts consisting of cakes, cupcakes, and cheesecakes. <br>
		The different flavors included chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, red velvet, mint chocolate chip, and cookies and cream. <br>
		I made desserts for birthdays, anniversaries, and just for fun. I found that my ability to customize desserts, even <br>
		within similar flavors, increased. Customization with cakes is really easy because there are so many different elements <br>
		to creating cakes. You can change out the sponge flavor, fillings, frostings, decorations, and toppings, all to make <br>
		the cake perfect for the people or person you are making it for. 
	</p>
	
	<h3> Goals </h3>
	
	<p> 
		One thing that helped a immensely when continuously baking throughout the year was having a list of desserts and flavors <br>
		I wanted to test out. This allowed me to feel like I was doing something for myself, learning more, and achieving goals in <br>
		the process of creating desserts for others. A lot of the time, the flavors and designs of the cake were totally up to me, <br>
		so I was able to choose different techniques in creating the cakes that I wanted to try out. Some of these techniques <br>
		included drip cakes, watercolor cakes, several fillings and frostings, and different cake sizings for emphasis on the <br>
		design and decoration elements.
